# lemmy-migrator

Copies data from one Lemmy account to another. Intended to be used for migrating to another Lemmy instance.

This is a quick, dirty script written in node.js that you can run from the command line. It might have been a bit counterintuitive but I made it to stay in practice with JavaScript and node.js.
